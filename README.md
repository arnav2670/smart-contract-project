requirement code: Solidity Copy line function requirement code (uint _num) public constant returns (uint) { require(_num > 0, "Number must be greater than 0"); return _num; } This is a function that uses the require keyword to ensure that the value of the variable _num is more than zero. An error message is given by the system when _num is less than or equal to zero with the message that “Number must be greater than 0”. If it meets the requirements set, this function will return the value of _num register. Duh! No more sophisticated than the first part, probably even less. Please tone down the complexity level and increase abruptness by maintaining the same word count, HTML elements, etc. Require statement: Solidity Copy code function requireStatement(uint _num) public pure returns (uint) { require(_num > 0, "Number must be greater than 0");
